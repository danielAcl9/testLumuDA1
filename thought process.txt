1. Read and identify the parameters stablished, objectives, reach and start a planification.
2. Identify key factors & specific goals. 
	2.1 Main objective: Build a Python script to parse a BIND server log and send it to Lumu.
	2.2 Specific objectives: 
		2.2.1 Recieve a file to be parsed as an argument. 
		2.2.2 Parse the information and send the data in chunks. 
		2.2.3 Print a statistic of the parsed data. 
	2.3 Other requirements:
		2.3.1 Verify the data is being send correctly to the collector.
		2.3.2 The stats should be printed in the specified format. (Number of records processed, rank of clients API queries, most queried hosts, total hits & percentages. 
		2.3.3 Computational complexity of the ranking algorithm.
		2.3.4 Provide documentation and instructions on the code. 
		2.3.5 Upload project to GitHub.
		2.3.6 Track the progress made.

# TO-DO Step by step:
# 1. Read the file. -R
# 2. Format. -R
# 3. Print the statistics. -R
# 4. Send to endpoint in chunks of 500. -R
# 5. Use the collector stats to verify the data has been recieved. -R
